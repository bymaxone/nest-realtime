# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- **The npm package page showed no documentation.** `1.0.0` reached the registry
  with an empty `readme` field, so the page rendered nothing — even though
  `README.md` was present in the tarball all along. Every package here published
  under pnpm 11 has an empty `readme`; every one published under pnpm 10, which
  delegated to the npm CLI, carries it. The same split appears in `_npmVersion`,
  present only on the publishes the npm CLI performed. The release workflow now
  calls `npm publish` directly, and this release is what carries the README to
  the registry.
- **`keywords` were missing from the manifest**, so the package was
  undiscoverable by search on npm. Fourteen added, covering the transports,
  the pub/sub and presence concepts, and the React subpath.

### Removed

- **The Roadmap section of the README.** It described work that is not shipping
  and dates the moment it is written; the issues board is where direction
  belongs. `README.md` ships in the package, so the section was on the npm page
  too.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-02

First published release.

### Added

- **Dual-transport architecture** — SSE (default) and WebSocket (opt-in) via the `ITransport` abstraction; `CompositeTransport` for `transport: 'both'` migration mode
- **`RealtimeService`** — unified server-side API: `emitToUser`, `emitToTenant`, `emitToRoom`, `broadcast`, `joinRoom`, `leaveRoom`, `disconnect`; cross-instance variants via `*Local` methods
- **`IConnectionAuthenticator`** — plug-and-play auth contract; the library never imports a concrete auth library (auth inversion); supports cookie HttpOnly, ticket, and bearer patterns
- **`EventReplayBuffer`** — per-user ring buffer for `Last-Event-ID` seamless SSE reconnect
- **`IRealtimePubSub`** — cross-instance pub/sub abstraction; `InMemoryPubSub` default; `RedisRealtimePubSub` reference implementation (requires `ioredis`)
- **`IOfflineQueueStorage`** — events delivered while a user is offline; `RedisOfflineQueue` reference implementation
- **`IPresenceStorage`** — optional online-user tracking
- **Lifecycle hooks** — `onConnect`, `onDisconnect`, `onError`, `onReauthenticationFailed` (fire-and-forget)
- **Re-authentication policy** — periodic credential revalidation with a positive cache
- **Heartbeat keepalive** — `: keepalive` SSE comment line tuned for real-world proxies (Nginx, Cloudflare, AWS ALB)
- **`@socket.io/redis-adapter` integration** — WebSocket horizontal scaling via the `websocket.redisAdapter` option
- **Multi-tenant room conventions** — `user:{id}`, `tenant:{id}`, `resource:{type}:{id}`; auto-join on connect
- **`forRoot` + `forRootAsync`** — synchronous and asynchronous dynamic-module configuration
- **Frontend React subpath (`./react`)** — `useRealtime` (auto-detects SSE vs WebSocket), `useRealtimeConnection`, `usePresence`, `RealtimeProvider`, `useRealtimeContext`
- **`socket.io-client` dynamic import** — kept out of the SSE-only static bundle (SSE-only bundle ≤ 4 KiB brotli)
- **Zero direct dependencies** — everything via peer deps (`rxjs` always required; WebSocket / Redis / React optional)
- **FIFO connection eviction** — exceeding `maxConnectionsPerUser` closes the oldest connection (`REALTIME_TOO_MANY_CONNECTIONS`); the new connection is always admitted

### Security

- **Auth inversion** — the library never imports `@bymax-one/nest-auth`, `@nestjs/jwt`, or any auth concrete; consumers own the auth implementation via `IConnectionAuthenticator`
- **Tenant isolation** — enforced server-side via the room registry; `emitToTenant` and `emitToRoom` scope delivery to the caller-specified room only

- **Peer floors declared above their published advisories.** Ranges drafted for
  this package admitted versions carrying published advisories, and were
  corrected before anything was published — so no released version ever carried
  a permissive range:

  | Peer             | Advisory                                                                                                                                    | Vulnerable                    | Floor      |
  | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------- |
  | `@nestjs/common` | [GHSA-cj7v-w2c7-cp7c](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cj7v-w2c7-cp7c) — remote code execution via the `Content-Type` header              | `>= 11.0.0-next.1, < 11.0.16` | `^11.0.16` |
  | `@nestjs/core`   | [GHSA-36xv-jgw5-4q75](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-36xv-jgw5-4q75) — improper neutralization of special elements in downstream output | `<= 11.1.17`                  | `^11.1.18` |
  | `socket.io`      | [GHSA-25hc-qcg6-38wj](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-25hc-qcg6-38wj) — an unhandled `error` event crashes the process                   | `>= 3.0.0, < 4.6.2`           | `^4.6.2`   |

  A peer range is a statement about which versions this library supports. A
  floor below a published advisory tells a consumer that a vulnerable install is
  a supported one, and nothing in their tooling contradicts it — the install
  resolves cleanly and silently.

  `@nestjs/platform-socket.io` and `@nestjs/websockets` keep `^11.0.0`: neither
  has a published advisory, and narrowing a range without a cause only costs
  compatibility.

  The `socket.io` floor was found by the scheduled `peer-advisory-drift` check
  rather than by the manual sweep that raised the NestJS floors — that sweep
  asked about NestJS and never put the same question to the other ten peers.
